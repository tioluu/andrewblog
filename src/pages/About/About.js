                Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I ramble about movies, my career, and the occasional existential crisis. I'm Andrew, a hopeless romantic with a penchant for depressing films and a love for Wong Kar-wai that borders on unhealthy.
            </p>
            <p className="about-paragraph">
                By day, I'm a developer who spends more time debugging code than actually writing it. But in my heart, I'm a frustrated film critic, constantly analyzing the emotional depth of every frame and wondering if I could have done it better. (Spoiler alert: I couldn't.)
            </p>
            <p className="about-paragraph">
                Now, I'm on a quest to conquer the world of data science, because what's more romantic than crunching numbers and visualizing trends? I mean, who needs love when you have a well-crafted scatter plot, am I right?
            </p>
            <p className="about-paragraph">
                But don't worry, I won't bore you with the technical jargon. I'll save that for my grad school applications, where I'll undoubtedly wow the admissions committee with my ability to use big words and make simple concepts sound complicated.
            </p>
            <p className="about-paragraph">
                So, join me on this journey as I ramble about the movies that make me cry, the data that makes me swoon, and the occasional random thought that makes me wonder if I should have just stayed in bed. It's going to be a wild ride, but hey, at least it'll be a depressing one.
